# AutoHotKey 2 MIDI

This is an AutoHotKey script that translates MIDI messages into keystrokes.
 - AHK reads incoming MIDI messages and displays them in a small desktop window
 - AHK sends out a keystroke, dependent on which MIDI message was received
 - The currently open app receives these as if they were typed on the keyboard
 
This way any MIDI device with pushbuttons, knobs and sliders can be used as a hardware console to operate any Windows app.
 
Included are
 - AHK script with shortcuts to operate the DaVinci Resolve video editor via the Behringer X Touch One.
 - A Bome MIDI Translator configuration file in case you prefer to use the [Bome app](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator).
 - AHK script to control Magix Video Pro X, added by Erich Grubm√ºller.
 
Keystrokes can be changed to your liking via the 'if' statements from line 40 onwards.

I like to mention I didn't program the MIDI tranlation part of the AutoHotKey script.
I found it [here]{https://github.com/genmce/AHK_Midi2Keypress}. Author unknown.
What I added are the X Touch One > DaVinci shortcuts.
 
Have fun.
